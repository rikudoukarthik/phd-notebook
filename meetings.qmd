New meeting note files can be made with `quartoutils::make_meeting_notes()`. 
These files are saved into the `weekly-notes` subdirectory; or alternatively, they can be stored into a project subdirectory by passing the argument `project = ...` to the function. 
Meetings associated with specific project tags are listed under the corresponding project landing pages, or can be viewed directly from the Meeting Notes landing page.
