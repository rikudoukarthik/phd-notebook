The function `quartoutils::weekly_notes()` makes it easy to create and edit a weekly notes file. 
Specifically, if a weekly notes file for the present week does not exist^[i.e. a file with the name `week-of-YYYY-MM-DD.qmd`, where `yyyy-mm-dd` is the year-month-date of the *Monday* of the current week], `quartoutils::weekly_notes()` will make this file, using a pre-determined template.
If such a file already exists, `quartoutils::weekly_notes()` simply opens this file for you to edit. 
The file also automatically gets added to a table of all such files, which is accessible from the "Weekly Notes" landing page of the website. 
This functionality is demonstrated in the video below.
