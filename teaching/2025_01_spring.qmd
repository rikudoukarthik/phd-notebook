*I missed this prep meeting because of my Internationl Student Orientation*

## 2025-01-17

- School closure possible next week due to winter storm predictions
	- Inform students of due dates in pre-week email: Syllabus and Safety quiz still due by 27th even if school closes, while other ICA will be pushed (all classes and schedule in general will be pushed forward by 1 week)
- For pre-lab quizzes, which TAs cannot open and view, if anyone emails saying they missed the deadline, forward the request to Dr B because she can heck if they’re lying (we can see their activity log on Moodle)
- **Do not** share grades with anyone except the student. In exceptional cases, forward to Dr B and mention that Student Advisory board can provide an authorization form.

- In Scientific Methods **only**, they can use AI for the ICAs. **Ensure they are aware that they cannot use AI in any of the other assignments.**
	- They need to: choose a topic (from the list provided), give a prompt to create a biological case study in __ field; rest should all be done by themselves (coming up with questions, hypotheses, predictions, etc.
	- The AI demo video is available in the PPT only in the instructor version, but students can find it in “Lecture videos” on Moodle.
- Emphasise that even if we TAs go through in class and help students (even if suggest corrections), doesn’t guarantee 100% grade; tell them there’s a reason grading is done completely separately and not in class.
- Template for ICA is available on Moodle, which they can download and edit.

**Grading**

- Don’t go via “Grade” button on first page; click the “View all submission” instead; then the “GradeMark” pencil button for each student to open Turnitin rubrics etc.
- It is fine if total grade comes to >100%, like with bonus points

### Geaux Communicate (Becky Carmichael, Negar Basiri)

**Feedback and Culture: Audience and Language**

- Communicate with cultural competency

When an instructor noticed an assignment of yours and responded on its qualities… Can’t remember a specific instance, but some important points: 

- Not focusing on the grading so much as on the content and feedback on what can be improved
- Even if something is wrong, treating it respectfully and trying to compare and contextualise with what is right
- Treating uncertainties positively / admitting their own uncertainty
- *Connection*

What are your current feedback strategies?
- Using “should”, “must”, etc. sparingly
- Giving positive feedback as well
- Providing adequate reasoning for feedback

- “[NAME], please …”

Let’s establish a common language:
- Define key terms
- Review rubric
- Provide and discuss a Common Mistakes document
- Annotate assignments to demonstrate feedback language
- Share a respond-to-feedback template

C-I Teaching Toolkit available

### Prep

- After Techniques review, go over lab forecast, emphasis on Partial Lab Report in all Enzymes classes—writing, DON’T COPY

- TAs should leave SAA cases ungraded, Dr B will handle soon
- Review should go only for max 1 hour (inc. student presentations ideally 3—index cards/PPT and bar graph by hand on board)
- Mid-term should start 1 hour after class start time
	- Those who scheduled with ODS TC can leave after the presentation because exam will be separate (and graded by Dr B)
- Switch off all electronics, no headphones—even better, remove and keep in bag
- Write names and sections legibly on midterm paper
- DO NOT write anything on word banks because we collect them back, and they’re supposed to be a reference for the fill-in-the-blank questions
	- There’ll be separate rough sheets for calculations, or can even use blank space in the end of the test booklet
