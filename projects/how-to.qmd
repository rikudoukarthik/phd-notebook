The function `qurtoutils::make_project(projectname = "...")` simplifies the process of creating a new project subdirectory. 
A new directory is created under the `projects/` directory, using the name specified in the argument `projectname`. 

The project has the following directory structure:

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("project-1")

```

The `index.qmd` file for the project will automatically search for weekly meeting notes and reading notes that have the same `projects` tag as the name for the newly made project.
