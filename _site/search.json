Click around on the tabs above to explore some of the functionality of this template site. There are (at least) two ways to use this template. If you are part of the gklab group on Gitlab, the easiest way is to use this project as the “template” to create your very own repository on GitLab. See the Video or Written steps below for detailed instructions\nIf you are not part of the gklab group on Gitlab (or wish to host this on Github instead), you can directly create a copy of this notebook project onto your computer with the following command: quarto use template https://gitlab.com/gklab/templates/lab-notebook-template-2/-/archive/main/lab-notebook-template-2-main.zip. If you choose to go this route, you will have to connect the repository to Git etc.; I assume you know how to do this.\n\nSteps for gitlab users\n\nOnce logged into GitLab, create a new repository by clicking on the blue “New Project” button at the top-right of the screen.\nSelect “Create from template”.\nClick over to the “Group” tab to see our lab-specific templates.\nClick on the blue “Use template” button next to “Lab notebook template 2”.\nProvide a name for this notebook – something like firstnames-notebook is probably easiest.\nFor now, you will be required to place this new repository under the gklab/ workspace (but I will walk through how to move this into a differnt location if you so wish).\nYou can decide whether to keep it as a public or private repo.\nOnce created, this repository is ready to use! You can clone this repository locally by copying the SSH link and cloning into a new Rstuio Rproject.\nIf you wish to move this repository out of the gklab/ workspace, click on “Settings” on the bottom-left menu, and then navigate to General.\nExpand the “Advanced” settings, and scroll down to “Transfer project”.\nUnder “Select new namespace”, you should see an option to transfer this into your gitlab user namespace. :::"

What were you hoping to learn but was missing?\n\nI didn’t have many specific expectations going in. But since there was so much emphasis on predictive ecology, I was a bit underwhelmed when their models (especially Traitspace) were shown to perform rather poorly.\nFemi: really missed the evolutionary/historical perspective\nRichard: role of microbes missing\nAnita: wish they’d expanded on how the filter view is problematic, at least in the Filters chapter\n\nWhat do we stand to gain if the field of community ecology shifted towards conducting research in the spirit of Keddy and Laughlin? What would we lose?\n\nIf we were to take parts of Keddy & Laughlin’s advice, I think the field would become more holistic and have more immediate impact especially for application. For instance, a stronger emphasis on prediction will likely lead to the development of much better modelling approaches in shorter time.\nHowever, if we were to take their full advice verbatim, we would unfortunately narrow down the field again (e.g., omission of competition, dispersal, other interactions; science vs natural history).\n\nIf you were to put forth a different set of “priorities” for community ecology, how would you structure them? (If you are not a community ecology researcher, you can apply this to your domain)\n\nNot really sure. I don’t know if I necessarily disagree with the priorities they have chosen, mostly just disagree with how they’ve chosen to think about them.\nI think even if many definitions may be arbitrary and/or dynamic, it is important to ensure that terms are used uniformly across the field.\nImproving predictive power is definitely a good priority to work towards. I would extend that more generally and say improving the robustness of study design as well as analytical methods is important.\nZ: involve stochasticity\nRachana: incorporate spatial scale. Maybe also applicable to disciplines like invasion ecology.\nRichard: dynamic species pools, incorporate extinctions, climate-driven drift\nGaurav: thinking a lot about predictive ecology. Should we be emphasising prediction so much, or should we prioritise understanding first?\n\nKyle: all natural phenomena divided into patterns and processes; Kyle thinks K&L is pattern-based approach, not process-forward like Vellend. Pattern-based often used for predictive purposes, not necessarily explanatory.\n\n\nIf the goal of community ecology is to predict species vector with relative abundances, how would you articulate the value in this science—aside from the context of environmental change and conservation?\n\nTo me, there is value in even just the understanding we gain about things like assembly. But do other community ecologists agree, or do they think there are other more important values?\nAnita: canonical three goals of science: understand, infer, predict\n\nIs the way they’ve presented the conceptual framework unique and useful for beginner students?\n\nAhmani: Think so, especially the way they’ve provided many examples, analogies, multiple systems\nAnita: Think Vellend book is comparable in how they’ve presented the framework, also of course considering drift, etc. The examples in Keddy & Laughlin and them providing data & code is useful and commendable\nZ: do we agree that the logical flow is one strength of the book? - Gaurav: yes across chapters, no within chapters\nGaurav: kinda surprised restoration ecologists were so receptive about their views\nKyle: prefer Vellend as first read, but think Keddy & Laughlin should also be part of reading"
